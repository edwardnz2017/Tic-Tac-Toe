# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe focusing on using the module pattern to write Javascript

For this project, I tried to only use factory function instead of class or object literals. Also, as you may see in the Javascript file, every variable and function is grouped together, as my focus for this project was to practice using the module pattern for cleaner code.
